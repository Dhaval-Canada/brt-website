Kalakshetra Style- This is a modern style of Bharatnatyam and a simplified form of Pandanallur style. It mainly focuses on Angika (hand movements). The hand movements are delicately based on the words of the lyrics and placing the hand in an exact position even during narration. It is the most beautiful of all style of Bharatnatyam. 

The Kalakshetra style was a unique creation of Rukmini Devi Arundale, (born February 29, 1904,Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India. Born to South Indian Sanskrit scholar and historian K.A. Nilakanta Sastri and his wife Seshammal. She had studied Pandanallur style and wanted to revive the slowly dying art form.  Kalakshetra evolved to be one of the most austere styles of Bharatanatyam. Elements of Shringara Rasa (the essence of erotic love) and any movement that portrayed vulgarity were entirely removed. Kalakshetra is thus purist and traditional in that sense. She is founder of Kalakshetra Foundation, working towards development and spreading knowledge of Bharatnaatyam.
